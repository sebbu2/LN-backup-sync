      "description": "Kyros Steele was the strongest warrior in the Omega Kingdom. But when the Great War of All began, this kingdom fell. Kyros was captured. \r\nDestined to become a slave through necromancy, Kyros could only curse at his led bitter life.\r\nBut on his final moments, he meets an eccentric Old Man who claimed to be the God of Time.\r\n\r\nMuch like Kyros, this Old Man was fated for suffering and defeat. Because the God of Time could not be killed, the Great Gods conspired to curse him and make him human first. And so the God of Time escaped but was now human.  Even if he used his powerful magic to send his consciousness back in time, he would still be defeated, for his soul was no longer a god but a man.\r\n\r\nHelpless as his time-traveling rebirth would easily fail, the God of Time offers and asks for Kyros's help. He would send Kyros back along with his own consciousness back in time. This would hide the God of Time from his enemies and give Kyros the chance to fulfill his revenge.\r\n\r\nJust when the two were about to time travel,  a shocking mystery caused the God of Time to marvel in awe. Kyros was not a human but had the bloodline of the most accursed and dangerous race of all.\r\nKyros is the legendary Nephilim.\r\nAnd so begins the Ascension of the Nephilim.",

It wasn’t as simple as climate change or tectonic movement. No, the fundamental laws of physics that governed everything were changing. \n\nLeonel was fairly lucky. His family was decently well off, his father loved him enough to brew vomit inducing nutrient rich smoothies every morning, and this was both the day of the National Championship and his 521st confession to his dream girl, Aina. As his father always said, nothing was more important than respect and persistence. \n\nUnfortunately, everything changed that night. At the after party of ages, the world reached a saturation point and an apocalypse descended. \n\nAbilities awakened. Sub-Dimensional Zones opened. Invalids rampaged through the Earth like a virus...\n\nThose who could evolve would have a slim chance for survival. Those who couldn’t would die. \n\nThis novel will be a unique spin on the dungeon/system genre. Dungeons won't be dungeons and the system won't be a system... Take a look to find out what I maen :)\n\n--------\n\nFor Updates - @Awespec on twitter or https://discord.gg/xFejEcj for discord\n\nhttps://dimensional-descent.fandom.com/wiki/Aina_Brazinger\n\nI will be posting this story on RoyalRoad.com\n---------------\n\nCover Art: twitter@ying0yi",

Now, you may not agree with how the novel develops, but I can at the least guarantee that you will have no trouble actually reading what happens.\n\nOf course, I am not perfect, so please feel free to point out mistakes and problems and I will be more than happy to fix them!\n\n===Foreword===\nEvolution/Non-Human/Unique MC: If you like evolution based novels and nonhuman MCs, then you've come to the right place. The whole novel will be about consuming creatures and their bloodlines and evolving. \n\nThe MC is also not the average isekai'd by truck average dude in most transmigration stories, it is an alien monster from the very beginning if that interests you any. \n\nCold/Ruthless/Villain - Anti-Hero MC: If you like MCs that are on the colder and more ruthless side, the MC does not operate by conventional human morals and starts off as a villain and will be a questionable anti-hero at best.\n\nSlow Pace: Like my other novel on this site, this novel will have a slow pace compared to other works. Hopefully, this will enhance your experience as a reader with description rich, vivid and engaging fight scenes and environments. \n\nThe slow pace will also contribute to fleshing out a significantly developed world as well as setting up for plot events that will have relevance throughout the entire novel.\n\n===Updates===\nUpdate Rate:  ~7 chapters a week with mass releases depending on powerstone ranking\n\n===Discord Link===\nhttps://discord.gg/mKvkT36pSQ\nFeel free to pop in anytime to ask questions!",

But there is something here that is not existing in many galaxies that humans have conquered... magic.\n\nUnfortunately for him, before he could explore the new world that resembles Earth, he died.\n\n*******\n\nYes, the whole volume 1 was for the sake of retrieving the spaceship aside from world-building, etc. \n\nThere will be a lot of unanswered questions or missing information at the beginning but don't worry... everything is planned and will be revealed in later chapters.\n\nAlso, the first half of the first volume was inspired by 6 or so animes and 4 other novels. Good luck finding them. \nThanks for reading!\n\n[ P.S. This is my first book so please keep it in mind. I hope you consider reading all free chapters first. Anyway, I assure you that my writing will get better as the story goes. ]",

In the midst of all these confusions, towers that gave unimaginable powers began to appear in all corners of the world, where those who already had powers could upgrade and become more powerful or even those who did not have powers could receive powers through tests of the tower.

Before he could think that the whole wedding ceremony was a setup to catch him, he felt dizzy all of a sudden!\n\nAt that moment, he knew that his lifelong friend had already betrayed him and sold him out. John was humiliated in front of hundreds of people and was forced to kneel in front of Thomas, the underworld assassin organization leader.\n\nWithin a few minutes, they beat him brutally, dragged him to some underground basement, and then locked him in a gloomy room. \n\nJohn felt bitter when thinking about his friend's betrayal. He laid on the cold floor for two days and died miserably. But his story didn't end there.\n…\nIn a world filled with magic and mystic powers, John Browning woke up in an 18-year-old boy's body.

      "description": "Li Wensheng transmigrated to an era where all energies were returning and every citizen practiced martial arts.\r\nHere, champions focus on martial arts mastery, becoming physically peerless as they honed their spirit. They would also seek superior weapons, including unbreakable war axes, or keen blades that could cut a giant tree with a single swing. \r\nEven so, Li Wensheng learned Immortal Arts from the very start! Though his scrawny form was exceedingly inconspicuous at first, he wielded Immortal Arts to smash long blades with his bare hands and crush giant hammers! \r\nLi Wensheng was flying everywhere on his sword while others were busy trying to surpass the limits of human speed. He could kill with a leaf or flower he plucked while others requested blacksmiths to hone their weapons. He cooked medicinal pellets with his cauldron, brewing Yuan Pellets that ascend cultivation while others trained their bodies to strengthen themselves. \r\nMartial arts champions: “Why aren’t you using any weapons?” \r\nLi Wensheng smiled, two of his fingers casting an immortal technique: Ten Thousand Swords Retrogression!\r\nAt his words, every sword behind everyone’s back took to the skies without hope of control, gathering behind Li Wensheng into a rain of swords that covered the skies! \r\nThis is a world where I alone cultivate immortality while everyone else trains in martial arts!\r\n",

These islands, known as Nightmare Islands, were true nightmares to all but the strongest and most fortunate. Children were kidnapped and thrown on these isolated islands by the Nightmare Palace. There, they were forced to sign soul pacts with evil soul pets: Nightmares. These devils slowly devoured the souls of their trainers to grow stronger. If the children did not cultivate fast enough, then their souls would be devoured whole, leaving only an empty husk behind.\n\nChu Mu, the protagonist, was an heir to the Chu Clan, but due to a plotted murder, he was thrown to the island, sentencing him to almost certain death. Dancing on the edge of life and death, he struggled to survive with a small Moonlight Fox he captured. When he finally escaped the devilish foremen on his island, he couldn’t help but let a breath out. But little did he know, the experience was only a beginning to a fated journey with his little Moonlight Fox…",

I'm not dead yet? Holy cow, I transmigrated into the body of a notorious hidden boss who controls half the world's wealth in an alternate universe after he failed his heavenly tribulation? I never have to worry about money? I can live forever? Lucky me!\"\n\nAlbion thought he had shot to the peak of life, but he could not be more wrong. The immortal body was too strong for a mortal soul like him to control. He can only move for 5 minutes a day!\n\nHe became immobile and paralyzed for the rest of the time! The Four Horsemen of the Dark Emperor thought he was crippled and turned on him! They couldn't kill him physically due to his invincible body so they dropped him to the bottom of the ocean to drown!\n\nHis body was immortal. He could not die. \n\nThus, he lived the following life in the dark depths of the ocean before being swallowed into the stomach of a giant sea serpent!\n\nBefore he could enjoy his new life, he had sunk to the lowest point of his life, literally!\n\nHowever, the world rapidly changed after the notorious True Immortal disappeared for two years! The Apocalypse arrived, and so too, the System!\n\nDing! \n[You have slain a Lv.1 ancient sea serpent. 100 EXP has been gained.]\n[You have leveled up.]\n[You have become a Lv.2 Hunter.]\n[Title acquired: Hunter.]\n\nAlbion: ???\n\n\"Did the sea serpent get food poisoning and died from eating me or something?\" Albion wondered in the pit of the sea serpent's stomach.\n\n[System calibration complete. Goldfinger has been activated.]\n\n\"Never mind, my time has come! With the system in hand, I will take back everything and rule the w--wait, what? This body's cultivation needs to be sealed in order for me to move freely without impairments?\" \n\n\"Sigh, forget it, ruling the world is too hard. I'm a wanted man anyway. Let's just hide somewhere, watch my animes, and reading my manga and novels...\"\n\nAlbion was nerfed harder than the Big Bang at the beginning of time. However, what's his, will still be his. \n\n\"Until my soul becomes strong enough to fully wield this power, I'll just treat it as a 5-minute Super Saiyan mode I can enjoy once a day...\"\n\nHe was not the Dark Emperor, but the Dark Emperor was now him. The Four Horsemen that turned on him, their day of retribution will come!\n\nLittle did Albion know, the world had more things in store for him than his quest for vengeance. The dimensional rifts that appeared everywhere and the interdimensional creatures that spilled forth from there are actually...!\n\nFind out on the next episode of drag--Ahem, to be continued.\n\n=====Author's Note=====\n\nFeel free to check out my other book, Prime Originator (also my first work).

The US is trying to recover from a decaying economy, and the world is witnessing the rise of events that would unleash World War II: Stalinism’s golden age, Nazism, Imperial Japan’s expansionism, etc. Some say that those events defined the destiny of our current world, but there was another one that impacted the curse of history one thousand times more. One that very few —if anyone— has ever heard of.\n\nIt all started in a dying, grim town in northern America that no longer exists called Merry Oaths. It was located in a state bordering the nation with the maple symbol and that’s surrounded by a vomit of swamps, forests, and the world’s biggest lakes.\n\nThere used to live a 16 years old girl called Vanilla Land; the daughter of a dead mother and a rich yet missing father that spent most of her time getting wrapped into adventures regarding supernatural events, which her world around was filled with.\n\nOne day, while investigating the case of a stingy fisher that made a deal with a supposed demon, a wicked entity saved her from death after she and a banshee apparition massacred each other. The hellish deity brought her back to life with one condition: to serve them in a series of missions until her debt is paid.\n\nSo Vanilla did; she got involved in multiple adventures where she befriended all kinds of eccentric people, fought the worst nightmares, and recovered the most surreal relics. That until she discovered the macabre truth: The world was near the ultimate cataclysm, which was going to end with everything as we know it and we don’t. \n\nThe solution, and the ultimate goal of the demonical being that rescued her from death's claws: to locate and use an ancient artifact known as the Sacred Chamber, which according to the old legends, was capable of redefining existence itself and grant godhood to whoever acceded it, as well as stopping the end of the world and beyond.\n\nBut Vanilla was not free, and there were some others who wanted to locate the chamber for themselves. Soon she got tangled between various entities —such as the very entity who resurrected her, a death cult, or a tortured yet acknowledged girl— that tried to manipulate her into deviating from her original mission. \n\nBut she discovered that maybe there was another way: one that guaranteed her own freedom and independence; free will and her personal supremacy. But nothing is free, and the path behind her was one carved with bones, sweat, and blood...\n\n\n\nCover art by Daniela Parra.\nInstagram: @danielaelric",

      "description": "[~Synopsis~]\n\n\nThis is not your usual isekai novel. it has my unique world background, unique power system and i am trying it make it a unique experience for every reader. :) I would really, really and seriously appreciate if everyone reads all free chapters before deciding to drop your coins and FPs in this one. Thank you.\n\nAthan, a 16-year-old boy, lived until he was killed for a stupid reason. ( stupid reason \u0026 more in the prologue:v )\n\nBut it seems that fate had stored different things for him as after death, His soul transmigrated to another world inside a dead body of a boy with the same name and same facial features as him.\n\nHe also found out that a mysterious black whirlpool seemed to be inside him and connected to his soul.\n\n\nAfter the short unfortunate first life, he starts living his second life with more suffering that he chooses himself to get stronger but with that also comes happiness he had never experienced. \n\nA smooth sailing second life of Athan starts with something mystical inside his body and other benefits of it that could make him stronger with some suffering. However...he didn't know that due to his soul ( That was supposed to return to the source of the universe after death but instead, it transmigrated by someone for some purpose and that caused an adverse effect like increasing misfortune on his soul ) The benefits he receives ultimately becomes the source of his second doom that is even worse than death. But...that's when the future Void emperor is born. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI wanted an MC that becomes stronger and reigns supreme without relying on anything external and he achieves his own unique power by virtue of his own hard work and ability. Although he gets benefits in the early stage of the story, That is the build-up for when he walks on the path he creates for himself. \n\nAs you read more, it will get better so don't give up after just the first few chapters, At least please read the 2nd volume as The Real adventure starts in Volume 2[ Bloody Universe.] That's why my 103 chapters are free. [note: The First R-18 Chapter is 41. ]\n\nThis is my first novel so expect some mistakes but I am striving to improve constantly because writing the story I play in my mind is so much fun and it's even more fun when people read it and enjoy it. \n\n----\n\nI've started using Grammarly premium from chap 90 and onward but I've still yet to edit early chaps...Though I'm definitely planning to edit them later and when I get free time.\n\nI hope you like this book. Thank you for reading.\n\nPS:- I don't own the images on my LN's Cover. If the original owner sees this message, You can contact me.\n\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/mCYTeRBuYx",

      "description": "The world is in a state of panic.\n\nEvery Friday, thousands of people in the world fall under a sudden deep sleep which for some reason causes their bodies to become immune to physical damage and is soon followed by those very people falling into a coma, unknown to the world as to when they will awake again.\n\nJunhyuk Lee is just an average guy on his way to a job interview. However, his interview happens to be on a Friday and on his way there he suffers an accident that changes his life.\n\nHe finds the answers that everyone has been looking for, but, in exchange, he is thrown into a world where his life is always in peril. Living side by side with death.\n\nHe has to fight and kill, to save himself and, possibly, the rest of humanity.\n\nFollow Junhyuk as he treads on the path of becoming a Legend amongst Legends.\n\n**A licensed novel from Munpia**\n\n---\n\nEditor Views - By Ekdud:\n\nLegend of Legend is a novel based on the battle arena games such as LoL, dota and others like it. Countless number of lifeforms of different races from multiple dimensions and worlds are brought into the ‘Valley of Death’ where they start off as minions and where a small percentage of them unlock abilities.\n\nThose who are able to unlock all 3 abilities, as well as the final ultimate ability, are able to become ‘Heroes’, the game characters we would be playing.\n\nIt is an extremely interesting novel because instead of viewing from the angle of the main focus of the game, the novel takes a different approach as the viewpoint is shifted towards the lackeys on the side. There are other ‘Heroes’ by the main character throughout the story as well where the allied Heroes are helping him and the enemy Heroes trying to kill him.\n\nAlso, the entire story is not entirely situated in the ‘Valley of Death’, the main character also has issues in his real life. The main character will have to deal and adapt as he switches back and forth between the ‘Valley of Death’ and the real-life world.",

      "description": "The smell of blood invaded my nostrils. I watched helplessly as the woman standing over me raised her sword. I was completely drained, I had no mana left, no items, nothing. As the crimson tendrils held me down by my arms and legs, all I could do was wait for my death. \n\nAs the sword drew near, I felt the last bit of courage I had disappear. I was going to die. Alone. In this god forsaken place filled with evil. And for what? To protect those ‘friends’? The same people who mocked me, took advantage of, and used me?\n\nOh, who am I trying to fool? I was here only because of my own greed. Because I wanted to be useful to someone. Because I wanted to that group to need me. To value me. To have a reason to keep me around. How naïve I was, thinking that power would grant those wishes. All it did was help build a wall between me and everyone else. \n\nThe sword approached. I saw the purple light reflect off the sword’s blade. After everything I went through, I hadn’t expected my death to be by the hands of another player. I saw her smile, but this time I didn’t think it was beautiful. It was an ugly smile because it was genuine. She was enjoying watching me die. She was enjoying killing me. \n\nThe sword struck my chest and pierced my heart. I let out a scream of pain and agony. The pain was so real, all of this was so real. It shouldn’t be, but it was. What should have been a simple game had become my new reality – all of our new reality. A reality filled with magic, war, blood, and death. \nMy vision darkened as the pain slowly faded. I felt the last of my vitality leave my body. It felt cold. I wondered to myself, when would I stop being? When would my thoughts disappear?\n\nSoon, I saw those words I feared for all this time appear before me. “DEATH”, in the pale blue font the game always used. They remained suspended in the air for several seconds. It was over. After a long time of fighting, grinding, and exploring, it was finally over. I had died. This was the end of my story.\n\nSuddenly, words before me shifted and changed into something different. I took a shallow breath as I heard a faint heartbeat.\n\n* * *\n\nCover art by me\n\n* * *\n\nWe have a discord!

      "description": "Do read my WSA 2021 novel **Alone: Tale of a Monster Hunter**. \nIt would mean a lot to me if you could read it and give your valuable review. Thanks in advance. \n\n****\nThe novel follows the story of Arnold, a porter, who accompanies warriors and superhumans inside dangerous dungeons, which are distinguished by their colours. The porters were always mistreated by the modern human civilization and even though their job was riskier than that of warriors and superhumans, their existence was never appreciated nor were they paid well.\n\nNo one knows why these dungeons started to appear all over the world. The only thing they know was the dangers that would find their way into the world if they didn't kill the monsters. But only a selected few cared about the calamity because for the rest it was all about earning money and gaining power. \n\nBut nothing in this new world is constant and everything keeps changing, and this time the change would find its way towards an ordinary Porter.\n\nAfter stealing a scroll from the dungeon, he ran off to his home. The scroll gave him powers no one could've imagined to gain. But he wasn't alone. 9 other humans had been granted similar powers... powers of the Gods! \n\nWhat would Arnold do with his newfound powers? Will he kill the other 8 Paladins and rule over the world which had oppressed him for years? Or will he rise against the Gods and make them repent for their crimes? \n\nCan the strength lent by the Gods be sufficient to deal with them once and for all? Would he be able to defeat his creator? Or will he join the Gods instead? \n\nToo many questions, too little time. The decisions he would make could be the end of humanity Or would an ordinary Porter, become he world's only hope? \n\nFollow me on the journey to the power of this ordinary Porter as he becomes the Savior or the Devil. \n\n*******************\n\nGold tier award-winning novel of WPC#130.\n\n*******************\n\nWarning:\nThere might be a few grammatical errors in the early chapters, so if you are a grammar nazI then please proceed with caution. \n\nAlso, the MC isn't very bright and will do a lot of stupid things from time to time. So if you like a cool and calculating MC you won't be seeing him like that until later chapters (Chapter 100 or so). I'm telling this to y'all here so you don't start yelling at me in the comments or review. All in all, I've tried to make the MC as realistic as I could. \n\nAny advice is appreciated.

Hearing the second choice, Aurus could not help but remember...that this was exactly the starting character of the game he used to play!\n\nWithout hesitation, Aurus chose the latter, bringing a smile to the goddess’ face…which seemed to contain secrets and desires hidden to the naked eye.\n\nAnd so, Aurus was reborn into a world that he was familiar with, albeit this time—he was now living a life as a stick! \n\nThough that may be the case, witness the adventures of Aurus as he turns the expectations of everyone around him upside down as he gradually returns to his previous heights… and perhaps, far beyond it!\n\nWitness the birth of a supreme being...from its roots!\n\n----------\nJoin me on Discord: https://discord.gg/eVzC5Ujw8q\nSupport me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/truedawnnovels\nFollow me on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/truedawn.uwu/\nFololw me on Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/truedawndesu\nOfficial IRAAS Wiki: https://dawnnovels.fandom.com\n\nCover made by zuharu_\nFollow him on Twitter: https://twitter.com/zuharu_\n----------\n10 chapter mass release coming at a future date.",

      "description": "Everything was going so well. It was the perfect path toward greatness. \n\nHe reincarnated to the World of Cultivation after dying on Earth. Though he was new to everything, he survived with little to no harm. \n\nHe learned how to battle, cultivate, and even how to love. He trained along with his wives, mastering all the nine elements, and they finally ascended together. They planned to continue their adventures together in the higher realm called ‘Heaven Realm’. \n\nUnfortunately, everything crumbled that day. \n\nJust as they thought they had succeeded, rushing through the passage between the Realms, they were attacked by the Heavens and forcefully split apart.\n\nThe separation was painful but adventuring without them wasn’t an option. \n\nXuefeng would never leave anyone behind.\n\nJoin us and follow Xuefeng as he dominates the Heaven Realm!\n\n_____________\n\nAgainst Heaven's Will is the continuation of \"Spirit Cultivation.\" It's advised to read them connected since this is book 2. The quality of book 1 is lower since its my first book but it gets better the more you read. Hope you enjoy this series. \n\nCheck out my other novels too!\nAuthor's Insta -> instagram.com/piokilek\nDiscord -> https://discord.gg/mFmYwyT",

I'm slowly editing it but it takes time. Once you reach later chapters, the quality gets much better. Book 2 of SC called Against Heaven's Will is the continuation of this book so make sure to check it out after you finish this one. \n\nSupport Author -> Patreon.com/Piokilek\nAuthor's Insta -> instagram.com/piokilek\nDiscord channel -> discord.gg/mFmYwyT",

      "description": "Thrust into an enigmatic world born from bloodshed; venture inside its complexities, dark-side, and always changing nature. At the center, a boy; brought up by an exiled mage, steps into a life of independence. A test to try and change his life for the better after witnessing what war can do to a person. The walk towards finding a stable living gets toppled as a unique magical element awakens. Using people, toying with emotions, doing anything and everything to get what he wants, this is the life of the next Death Reaper. Mostly emotionless, life continues as questions about his state of mind and being remains clouded behind many personas.\r\n\r\nThis isn’t the story of a single man, it’s the story of a whole world. Read as the world builds itself from the ground up. Conspiracies, evil, the dark side of humanity. In addition, tis the start of a new age; the birth of monsters – a story depicting the tales of the first heroes and demons to ever exist. \r\n\r\nThe Wielder of Death Magic isn’t a typical fantasy. The heroes don’t summon forth power from heroes of old, here, the characters are the ones who make up the myths and legends for the next generation. Amidst the turmoil, Staxius, he lives on, watching and waiting as the world grows. \r\n\r\nP.S, I’m not that normal of a writer, my advice is to not expect anything going into this world. Forget everything, I personally, don’t care about rules and limitations and what can be considered to be the norm – the characters are given life, the world moves on its own; I’m just a spectator. No plot, nothing planned, all that you read is the product of the characters moving and acting individually. As opposed to me subjecting them with my emotions, the connection is reversed. They are the ones who dictate the story (Believe it or not, that's the way I write) A world, a story, characters, and the foolish author; we all evolve as one. On behalf of the people mentioned above, thanks for reading, I appreciate it all.\r\n[Cover is copyrighted by Sxperimental]",

      "description": "Reed, a young man that had spent his entire life in the slums wished for a miracle. He dreamt that one day he'd escape the ghetto he had been born in and travel across the world. He longed to embark on an adventure and truly begin living a real life.\n\nAlas, it was not meant to be. The stars had other plans in mind for the young man.\n\nOn the night of his sixteenth birthday, he had his life flipped upside down. Caught in the midst of a confrontation between two rival gangs, Reed suffered a fatal injury.\n\nAs he laid on the street, Reed couldn't help but laugh at how unfair his life had been from beginning to end. \n\nBorn poor? Sure. No parents? Okay. No opportunities in life? Fine. But his own miserable life, too? \n\n\"What more can I be deprived of?\" Reed muttered as he struggled to keep his eyes open. \n\nA soft voice chuckled and said, \"Much, much more, boy. But you'll soon have the opportunity to have all your wishes fulfilled.\"\n\n\"...If you can earn the right to obtain them.\"\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nLet this message serve as a FINAL warning to those who have come in expecting the 'usual' type of story on this site.\n\nThis is 'NOT' a wish-fulfillment based story. \n\nPlease do NOT come into this novel with the expectation that you will get some kind of fearless action hero. The MC is everything but that.\n\nThat he will be... this 'fearless, intrepid' person straight out of the FIRST chapter. A bold, charismatic hero with an unshakable resolve and iron will.   \n\nGet that irritating preconception out of your head right now if you dare venture further into the story. \n\nI KNOW that's what you're expecting because that's the common setup with the stories on this site. \n\nI am writing a story about personal growth, above all else. Be forewarned about that. I'm serious.\n\nThat means that the character has to start from the bottom and work his way UP. Not in only in terms of power, but also in the strength of his character -- as in, maturing INTO someone who will become a hero. \n\nNot over the course of a SINGLE chapter like some stories do. Not in SINGLE arc, or volume, but over the course of the ENTIRE STORY.\n\nMy main character starts off as COWARDLY, INDECISIVE, and WHINY. He is by NO measure a heroic person, or EVEN a whole person. He is weak-willed and flawed because that is how I HAVE WRITTEN him to be, for good reason. \n\nNow, it's your right to DISLIKE this decision I've made and not read the novel because of that. Absolutely. \n\nIf you want an OP power-fantasy, then go find it elsewhere on the site. You do you. Don't let me or anyone stop you from reading what you want. \n\nBut if you read my novel for what it is and then give it a poor review, criticizing it for having a \"flawed, detestable, and pathetic main character,\" I WILL delete your goddamned review on that point alone. \n\ntl;dr: My main character isn't fucking He-Man and the Terminator's baby. He's a human being with all the ugly, pathetic parts you don't like seeing in your OP Reincarnation novels.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nAny comment or review you'd leave for the novel is worth more than gold to me. Have a good one.",

Konrad was chased from one corner of the world to another and ultimately cornered. But in a fit of fury, he chose to destroy what they worked so hard to obtain!\r\n\r\n“Screw your ten thousand ancestors! Only I can wield the golden rod! Since you want it so badly, then fetch its remains!”\r\n\r\nHe howled as he aimed a gun at the golden rod. But suddenly, the sky darkened, and purple lightning struck him from above.\r\n\r\n“Fool!

People say that in your final moments, darkness seeps in your very existence, engulfs your whole being. They say it’s an incredibly relaxing feeling that takes you on your journey to your afterlife. They say that in the very darkness, the ‘nothingness’ your weary soul will finally be able to rest and relax. This brings up some very philosophical and existential questions. Do you even exist?\n\nFollow the epic journey of Aiden, the last primal, a unique and ancient race as he finds his place in a strange, new world, filled with threats and violence.\n\n-----\n\nUPDATE: A supportive reader has created a Discord Server. Here's the link if you would like to reach out to me and/or join the community:\n\nhttp://discord.link/TheLastPrimal\n\n-----\n\nIf you would like to support me and leave me a personalized message, you can buy me a 'coffee' at Ko-Fi: https://ko-fi.com/shaele\n\n-----\n\nThis story (and the world itself) is something I started writing and creating 15 years ago, while I was telling stories with my friends in our regular D\u0026D sessions. The world is a hand-crafted fantasy world, filled with history and lore that we created over the course of years. While I may be new to the writing scene, I will do my very best to bring you an enjoyable experience. \n\nUPDATE: The current schedule (from September 2020): 1 chapter EVERY DAY (between 1500-1700 words)\n\nOne final note: I plan to write R-18 chapters later as well, but as you will see from the flow of the story, this is not feasible for the short term. Just hang tight, we will get there in a natural manner.\n\nHope you enjoy the journey just as much as I enjoyed creating it.",

I will lead guild Sol Invictus. Denizens of the 7 hells, respect me. Servants of the 11 heavens, know fear. Guild Invictus, know the suffering of training so you can wrest victory from the jaws of those who dare doubt you. \n\nThis is a story about a snake named Tycondrius waking up in a fantasy world of swords and sorcery. There is action, violence, unapologetic murder, and arrogant displays of power. There is an emphasis on combat growth as well as psychological growth on more than a few members of Guild Invictus. There is camaraderie and also the inevitable comedic dialogue amongst manly men. There are even elements of romance and Tycon running away from terrifying, powerful women. (Did you know most female snakes eat their partners after mating?) \n\nGive this book a read. I hope some of these stories can inspire you to fight your battles with analytical intelligence, heroic courage, and ruthless lethality. \n\nSchedule: 12+ chapters per week. \nMon-Fri 2/day @ 11:00 PDT\nSat-Sun (and Holidays) 1/day @ 11:00 PDT\nChapter Length: 1000+ words per chapter \n(Update 14Jun2021: Author is having issues.

The first volume would focus Lucifer and Juin's developments, especially the latter's development both in skills and character.  \n\nIt might seem a little slow pace at first, but that's because I'm trying to build a piece everything up one by one, giving you a better immersion as you journey through the Demon King's Cowardly vessel.\n\nHonestly, I would love to hear your opinions on the development of the characters and the world. If you like to discuss more with me, please go to the discord link below.\n\nhttps://discord.gg/Bva8QhZ\n\nAnd if you would like to support me monetarily outside of WN, please consider buying me a ko-fi at the link below.

There are difficulties, ups and downs, bumps and humps. \n\nLike most of the love stories, Mo Yichan and Yang Ning’s love story wasn’t smooth or easy. Initially it was difficult and rocky. \n\nThe CEO of Yang corporation, Yang Ning was a successful businesswoman. Growing up with unsupportive and unruly parents, Yang Ning was accustomed to being treated unfairly and poorly. The only person that she count on was her grandfather.\n\nThe CEO of Mo corporation, Mo Yichan who was also known as the ‘ Devil CEO’ was one of the most successful businessmen. Losing his father at a very young age and his mother leaving him alone for some other man, Yichan grew up with his grandfather. \n\nBeing business rivals, Mo Yichan and Yang Ning hated each other. \n\nWhat do you think will happen when these two cold and aloof people are forced to get married and live under the same roof by their grandparents? \n\nDid they hate each other only because they were business rivals? Or did something happen in the past which forced them to seal their hearts and hate each other to the fullest? \n\nWill the love between them ever be able to overpower the hatred that they have for each other? \n\n*****\n\n“ Hahahahaha look at you both fighting like a husband and wife.” Mr Hunshou said.\n\nYichan smirked and said,” If you were my wife, I would add poison in your coffee.”\n\nNing smiled and said,” And if you were my husband, I would drink it.”\n\n****\n\nFew months later.\n\nIn a charity auction.\n\n“ Hundred million.” Ning said.\n\n“ Two hundred million.” Yichan said before grinning at his wife.\n\n“ Three hundred million.” Ning said.\n\n“ Four hundred million.” Yichan said.\n\n“ Five hundred million.” Ning before leaning towards her husband,” If you let me win, I’ll be on top for a whole week.”\n\nYichan raised his board and said,” Seven million.” \n\n“ You-“\n\n“ For two weeks.” Yichan said.\n\nNing frowned and said,” Fine.” Before raising her board,” Seven hundred and one million.”\n\n***********\n\nFollow me on Instagram: author_sofia05\n\nJoin my server: https://discord.gg/th8TmZr\n\nSend me a Ko-fi: ko-fi.com/sofia05\n\n[P.S:The cover isn’t mine. :)]",

Dax is then faced with a complex problem,\nhe must secure the technology that he needs to leave while at the same time make sure the tools of war from his world is not misused at the cost of being made a target by powers he fails to fully understand.\n\nOn his way Dax will have run ins with various powers, some of them hostile, some of them a bit more amenable to persuasion and mutual cooperation. After all, what is a knight, king, angel, demon or grand wizard to a railgun or even a tactical class high energy laser in orbit?\n\nThey’re soft targets.\n\n\nFor the record, English is not my first language, so there might be some spelling/grammar mistakes here and there.

But at least one thing is sure....He won't go down as another speck of dust in history.\n\nPrepare yourselves, Demons, mysterious all-powerful organisations and Mythical Creatures.....An orphan just got his first taste of power and he won't stop now. \n\nWarning: If you're looking for a novel centered on cultivation, this is not it. The main focuses are characters, world building and the story. Thr cultivation aspect is there but I don't want to spend too much time on it. \n\nOther Warning: This novel will not be centered around Chinese's culture solely. It will explore culture from other Eastern Countries and even Western Countries.\n\nIf you wish to support me, head there: https://ko-fi.com/glasgow1",

Then he would try to augment his damaging power to unparalleled degrees by seeking for Marvel-Weapons; Treasure-weapons of tremendous, apocalyptic-level devastating power which belonged to dead, ancient divine experts that birthed the four forms of cultivation. \n\nBut would he be able to discover the Library System and the Gene System to gain new powerful abilities? The Ancestral Beast System to summon cloned versions of inexistent, planet-sized, havoc-wreaking abyssal creatures to aid him in the far-future deadly battles? And ultimately, Marvel-Weapons to vastly increase his overall destructive power? \n\nWould he able to achieve all these before the next, full invasion of his Realmverse? Or would he grow to become very powerful that he would then invade other Realmverses and become their hegemon? \n\n***\n\nSo, journey with our stunning hero, Alex as he begins to conquer known and unknown realms and dimensions, and unifies kingdoms and territories with the help of the 'Worlds Domination Ultimate Support System' which he would awaken later.\n\n***\n\nTags:\n\n--> # SYSTEM [Multiple Systems]\n--> # ACTION [Epic Battles]\n--> # ADVENTURE \n--> # CULTIVATION [Energy, Soul, Body \u0026 Bloodline (physique) Cultivation] \n--> # ROMANCE\n--> # HAREM\n--> # WEAK-TO-STRONG MC\n--> # KIND-AND-GENEROUS MC\n--> # NAIVE-TO-SMART MC\n--> # RUTHLESS MC\n--> # OVERPOWERED-MC\n--> # OVERPOWERED-ENEMIES \n--> # BEAST COMPANIONS \u0026 MONSTER PETS\n--> # MATURE (Above 18)\n--> # MYRIAD NON-HUMAN RACES\n\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*\n\nPS: This novel is set in a fantasy/quasi-technological universe.

Someone once loved treating others to chicken soup, so he kept nine phoenixes in his backyard. Someone once sat lazily on the top of mountains as his words flooded river banks, and his qi could hold a million soldiers back.

But like all great power, a heavy burden came with it.\nThe 10th to succeed grew tired of it all and wanted to lessen the weight he was bearing on his shoulders, to have a more comfortable life, and to have a family. He decided to split the World into Ten Domains and made his loyal Knights become the Domain Monarchs. Each of them became the Monarchs of Nine of the Ten Domains, with him overseeing only the Tenth. He named the domains from the names of the World Monarchs, including himself.\nAfter 36 years of peace and prosperity, a Great Catastrophe occurred, causing each Domain's countries to merge into one complete landmass. People who had inhuman abilities started to show up, and creatures of terror pouring out from who knows where—plunging the whole world into utter mayhem. These vile foreign creatures took over the Three of the Ten Domains, while the remaining are barely holding their borders from the monsters. Everyone looked to the man who was once called the \"10th World Monarch\", the symbol of authority and power, for guidance through their intense hardships. However, he was nowhere to be found. All hope was lost.\nThe protagonist of the story, born after the formation of the Domains, rescued an old man from a dangerous situation that led him in harm's way. Being in a vegetative state, he was unaware of everything in the outside world, including The Great Catastrophe. Waking up with the world already in ruins, and people adapted to the changes. The game-like mechanics that only Liu Kai can see will help him throughout his adventures to discover the mysteries of how the world evolved.\n===========================================\nJoin our Discord Server using this link (https://discord.gg/vZtfKFx), and you can suggest to the novel to a certain extent that we would allow you.

Armed with an unrivaled healing factor and an inhumane pain threshold, Kuro opts to go for a reckless direct approach in this world instead of a stealthy and cautious one, and as a result, slowly gains attention bit by bit.\n\nHaving previously been a loner in his old life, he interacts and befriends people for the first time in his existence, however, his blunt nature also sees him making just as many enemies, both big and small. By combining his old assassin skills with the magic powers of this world, along with his high resistance to pain and rapid regeneration, he doesn't take long to establish himself as a formidable force in this world. \n\nInitially, Kuro only faces minor threats, like weaker monsters and bandits. But before too long, the threats slowly but surely become more and more severe...from Zombies to a bloodthirsty empire to Vampires and Demons, and even divine beings...however, as the enemies he faces grow stronger, so does Kuro, gaining rare powers that have never or rarely ever been seen in this world...\n\nGenre - \r\nFantasy\r\n\r\nSub-Genres - \r\nIsekai, Action, Magic, Dark Fantasy, Romance, Comedy\r\n\r\nAge-Rating - \r\nPg-13 Warning: Mild Profanity, Mild Sexual Content, Violence",

I have watched the Great Pyramid being built, Rome being sacked, and unaccountable number of bloodsheds in the names of long forgotten Kings and Queens. Empire rises and falls, yet I remain. That is the single truth.\r\n\r\nEven the Modern Era is but a tiny drop in the ocean of time. History is just an experience to me. New Hollywood, what is that? Is that more interesting than the Great Migration or The Exodus? I will tell you all about it, the countless lives I have lived.\r\n\r\nAs the Master of Time, time itself is my servant. It is loyal to a fault, preventing death from claiming me. In effect, it forces me to wander all of time and space, for all of eternity. I wonder when, if ever I will be free from this curse and this gift!\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: Story contains graphical sex scene.\r\n\r\nTags: Time Travel, Ruthless Protagonist, Male Protagonist, Godly Power, Alternate History, Celebrities, Wars, Conquests, Kingdom Building.\r\n\r\n********************\r\nDiscord Server\r\nhttps://discord.gg/ffazvKp",

      "description": "-COMPLETED-\nWARNING: FL is scheming and evil.\n\nLike almost every dramatic romance novel, Lily Qin’s story began with an evil stepmother, a scheming stepsister, and a dumb ex-fiance. At twenty, she fell prey to their grand scheme and became the laughingstock of the country. In despair, she left.\n\n\nSeven years later, Lily Qin rose from the ashes.\n\n\nShe was labeled as an empress, an iron lady, a genius, and a prodigy. She was Miss Tycoon.\n\n\nNow, at twenty-seven, Lily Qin was an established businesswoman who was single-handedly controlling her multinational company abroad. She was beautiful, smart, and successful. Women envied her while men couldn’t help but worship her ethereal beauty.\n\n\nWith her devastating past, everyone had assumed that Lily would exact revenge on the people who had wronged her. Who would have guessed that behind that beaming smile of hers was a numb heart that aimed only to make more profit?\n\n\"You got it wrong.\" Lily elegantly propped her chin on the back of her hand. \"I am seeing you today because we have something in common. We're both villains in somebody else's eyes. And I think it's time for us villains to get our own happy ending. Don't you think so?\"\n\n\n---\n\n\nZhuo Jingren’s love for Lily Qin was something that only he knew. Ever since they were children, he had his eyes on her. Yet, every time he had tried to confess, he would end up fainting from nervousness.\n\n\nSo when Lily Qin promised to marry him if he became richer than her, Zhou Jingren did not hesitate to leave the orphanage and work his way up just to become her man.\n\n\nWho would have thought that years later, when he was successful and feared by many, he would come back to an engaged Lily Qin?\n\n\nThen she mistook him for an escort after eating his tofu? Preposterous!\n\n\nThe worst thing was, she seemed to have forgotten everything about him. Hadn’t she promised to marry him the moment he became more prominent than her family? Now, after taking advantage of him, she dared to run away?\n\nThis woman was a liar!\n\nHe gritted his teeth as he watched her approach him. He was about to say something mean when she suddenly spoke. “Are you my new bodyguard?” She did not even wait for him to answer before tossing her car keys at him. “Drive. Let’s go wreak some havoc.”\n\n\nThus, the mafia’s big boss became Lily Qin’s bodyguard.\n\n\n---\n\n\n\"So? What do you want as a compensation?\" Zhuo Jingren asked her once again before laying down next to her. His elbow was resting on the ground and his palm was supporting his head as he looked at her intently. \n\nThe first thing that Lily noticed about Zhuo Jingren when he laid next to her was his exposed tanned chest. This made him look more casual… and hot. She didn't even realize she was staring at the latter.\n\n\"Why are you staring at me like that?\" He smirked at her. \"Do you want me to compensate you with my body?\"\n\nLily immediately rolled her eyes at the latter. \"Who wants your body? Hmp! I want money!\"\n\n\"Your mind is always thinking of money but your body actually betrays you. Am I right to say that I have a shameless wife?\"\n\n\"Hah! I am a strong and independent woman of the 21st century. I know what I want. But if you insist on giving your body, I will take it too!\" Lily shamelessly said, taking off her stilettos. However, just when Lily was about to lie down beside Zhuo Jingren, he suddenly pulled her on top of him. With her body on top of his, their faces were really close and they could even feel each other's breath. \n\n\"What a shameless woman,\" he noted, the smile on his face only deepened.\n\n\n.... \nCover is mine.\nThere is no RAPE or MAJOR MISUNDERSTANDINGS.\nWARNING: FL is scheming and evil.\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Jw2Yjfr\nInstagram: @blips01\nEditor: Swaning, Ocelot",

When humanity tried to rebuild, they discovered that most technology no longer worked. The laws that governed the world had changed!\r\n\r\nSteam technology rose in popularity after the apocalypse. Humanity entered a new golden age. Then, the seven nightmares attacked. Espers with strange powers appeared. Mutants took over most of the world. This was the beginning of the Mana Apocalypse!\r\n\r\nMy name is Edward Tesla and I was born during the Mana Apocalypse. This is my story about trying to protect everything I care about in this living hell. My inventions will defeat the nightmares and save the world! Steam rifles, steam tanks, and steam mechs.

I guarantee the story continues to improve from there as you continue reading.  Political factions, wars, steam tech, mana mysteries, and more.

A world that has recovered to a state that is roughly equal to our own world in terms of technology and culture, although its ancient history remains largely unknown. The story begins during the post-graduation trip of our protagonist, where he discovers some ancient ruins and witnesses “the great change”, an upheaval that changed everything. The changing earth not only brought about new, unexplored landscape but also sparked the evolution of all organisms. Plants and animals started gaining sentience and some humans obtained unimaginable powers. The legends, myths, and tales of old seemed to have suddenly come to life as the earth entered a new era where beasts and men formed factions, explored new lands and ultimately struggled for supremacy.\r\nWe follow the MC as he grows from being an eccentric young man into a badass expert warrior while meeting other funny characters and forming brotherly bonds. We watch as he falls into just as much hilarious situations as he does perilous ones, all the while wondering and slowly discovering the mysteries of this world. Just why was the world destroyed in the first place? Who or what had triggered this earth-shattering “change”? What profundities lie behind the process of evolution? \r\n------\r\nChen Dong is one of the top authors in the Chinese Qidian site and this particular novel has been number one on its monthly charts for several months straight. If you are looking for a funny and unique novel that is free from the cliches of reincarnation and cultivation, this might just be what you are looking for. The story develops quite slowly for the first ten chapters or so but becomes much better paced afterwards.\r\n------\r\nRelease Rate: 7 Chapters/Week",

Our Dear Student Wang Zheng has finally started his lucky(?) university life!\r\nThis is the song of a blood boiling and exciting storm! The most ferocious and heated mecha adventure around is finally here!\r\nTL Note: This is a novel about doing the impossible, seeing the invisible. Follow along for a ride across the universe!\r\nTL;DR: Not Shakespeare, not complex, but fun and easy to read. Come support! \r\nAs the translator, I've enjoyed translating this novel and I hope to bring the essence of what the author has tried to portray into the chapters you will read.\r\nTo sum it up in 3 words: Mechs! Explosions! Science!\r\nTo be perfectly honest, this novel is about your typically overpowered protagonist who does get looked down from time to time but always overcomes the odds with his own special power. He's abit more mature having grown up on his own and just a littttttttle bit dense.\r\nAlthough it always ends up with him winning, it always happens in an interesting (subjective) and fun way that makes me enjoy reading this.\r\nThe novel has elements of lighthearted comedy from time to time and I do chuckle at how direct the humor is.\r\nIt's not as smart as say WMW nor does it weave an intricate story much like Ergen's novels. More importantly, its fun and it doesn't try to hide it.\r\n",

QI's system right now categorizes all novels taken from the female novel Chinese site (起点女生网) as 'romance' without fail, regardless of whether they truly are romance. So, if you are here just for the romance, you might want to find a different novel. There will be some romance eventually, but most of this novel is Sci-Fi/Xianxia with a lot of world-building and character development.\r\n \r\n2) I use British spelling. So, please ensure spelling errors are really errors before reporting them.\r\n \r\n3) No matter what the release rate up top says, the guaranteed release rate right now is 1 chp/day (a.k.a. 7 chps/week). All else is extra at my discretion. (I'll try my best, but RL responsibilities come first.)",
