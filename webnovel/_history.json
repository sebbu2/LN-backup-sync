With his limitless power, he could easily dominate the world, and neither Heaven nor Hell could stop his growth, but he chose the righteous path. However, for unknown reasons, he was betrayed and sealed to a deep slumber.After being sealed for eternity, Zeus woke up in a mysterious dungeon to find the person who broke his seal\u0026mdash; a half-angel beauty at death's door.The day of his awakening, he swore that he will get his revenge and reclaim what he has lost\u0026mdash;that is everything.

He will have some trust issues because of what happened in the past, but no useless drama.The Story development is slow but the story is not slow-paced. I believe character development, and building the plot is important than writing things that don't make sense. =====The characters' names and relations in the novel are based on greek, Norse, Egyptian, and other mythologies, but they are not accurate as they should be.

Just as Seuss was depressed and disappointed, and was about to give up on this game, the midnight bell rang. Everything around him started to twist and warp as if they were rewinding rapidly. When these changes stopped, Seuss was in shock. He realized that time had gone back one day. Everyone had returned to their status right at the moment they entered the game. However, he was able to keep everything that he had earned and received...",

The new maid was acting strangely, but I paid no attention to her weird personality because she was loyal to me.As days passed by, I began to have more maids around me. However, all of them were strange.It wasn\u0026rsquo;t until later I noticed that the maids would leave at night and return reeking of blood.Naturally, I was curious, but I\u0026rsquo;d never questioned them as they were my personal maids.To become stronger, I, Eddie Edward, continued to grow using the system to be not threatened by others in the future.Until a fateful day\u0026hellip;I learned something important. One of my personal maids was a Fallen Angel?And the other one was the Lady of the Dark that was being pursued by the Holy Church?Not only that, but I also heard some of my maids being addressed as the Lord of the Dard?The Ominous Witch? The Vampire Queen?Lady of the Death?Why did their names sound like they were some antagonists of a novel?Could it be that all of my personal maids were actually the bad guys of the world I was in?Not long after that, I was now a wanted person in the Lancamdo Kingdom? Some even began to hail me as the Lord of Evil?Eddie Edward let out a deep sigh. \u0026ldquo;Fine. Looks like I can drop the act now.\u0026rdquo;With a wave of his arm, the alliance of the mage and knight was wiped out with an asteroid.\u0026ldquo;To tell you the truth, I\u0026rsquo;ve already become the God of Magic.\u0026rdquo;",

The people living in the world could light the God flame by condensing their believers' faith to expand their divine realm, forming their own religion to become a High God.The divine realm could be grown indefinitely by having more followers and absorbing their faith. A follower's strength was closely tied to the gods they followed as well. However, unlike other gods, Sullo had a unique thousand-fold amplification system that made everything grow at a thousand times their original speed.A normal tree spirit had evolved into a World Tree that would expand his divine domain.A normal water snake had evolved into an ouroboros that would protect his divine domain.A normal behemoth had evolved into a golden behemoth that would lead the attack on other domains.A normal angel had evolved into a 12-winged archangel that would gladly sacrifice for their god.A normal elf had evolved into an elf queen that could heal anything\u0026hellip;Years later, as the other gods were still waging wars to gain control of the gnomes and dwarves, Sullo\u0026rsquo;s followers were already as powerful as other gods.",

But in a world meant for power, not everyone would agree to live with things that can easily dominate the human population. So, in spite of jealousy, humans tried to experiment on creatures to make it their own. As soon as the supernatural found out, most of the human population had agreed that any kind of species non human, was dangerous to mankind. Eventually, scientists gave up trying to duplicate creatures abilities and sought a way to get rid of any kind of magic...and a way to make sure no creature roamed earth.They started war.One of the greatest wars humans would say. For they achieved their plans and rid of the supernatural.Yet, only the toughest of the creatures survived and the smartest hid while they had the chance, leaving a few species to not go extinct.While the humans lived on their lives, suspecting they were free from the fear of higher beings...they were completely unaware of a future war that would bring their delusional fears to life.Little did everyone know, the fate of them all was in the hands of a teen girl named Noa. A teen that had the power to create peace among them all or destroy her opposing side...for she had yet to discover which side she truly belonged.",

      "description": "The second Ye Lulu transmigrates, she gives birth to three children on the spot.She imagines that she's the only transmigrator here and has to be careful. Who knew\u0026mdash;The first baby: Cold and stern, he's a young little adult who acts as a judge! He steps forward to draw a bolt of lightning from the heavens to punish scumbags.The second baby: Agile, lively, and extremely smart. Every time he moves his mouth, he can accurately predict the future!The third baby: One with an even colder personality, with a single wave of his finger, he can hook out your soul and play with it!Ye Lulu never had a boyfriend in the modern world. Yet, who would have expected that the moment she changed into a different identity, she would have children, a husband, and in-laws \u0026mdash; basically, the whole package? Initially, she says, \"The three babies are so cute. They're my biological children. I can have them! As for my husband\u0026hellip; I'll get a refund.\"Unexpectedly, Ye Lulu gradually realizes that her husband is very handsome! He seems very mysterious and charming! She seems to have developed feelings for him. How wonderful!However, Ye Lulu holds onto her little protective mask tightly and constantly warns herself to be conservative, as people in the ancient times are comparatively not as open-minded.Unexpectedly, that husband of hers is not himself either. He was a Yin God from the divine throne in the heavens where there were no restrictions, and thus is even more casual. One day, her handsome and god-like husband presses her against the wall and lifts his hand to hold her chin. He says to her in a husky voice, \"I think I like you\u0026hellip;\"He lowers his head and kisses her deeply!Ye Lulu: \"???\"Something is wrong here! Aren't you guys from the ancient past? Why are you so unrestrained?",

Magic is a scientific phenomenon that was made into reality by one of the noble pantheons, giving the rebels of fate a chance to send a gigantic middle-finger sharp clear to the sky.Using the Mana Sea within one's body, they can develop a path to glory and immortality to usurp the throne we call life. Expand the miniature realm of your mana depository to research Technique's Core, Magic Virus Factory, Golden Orb, and many other powerful discoveries within hidden realms with great secrets to uncover!But magic alone is not enough, you need to gather allies, develop your own blade, and enrich your dopamine in the face of danger.So rejoice, as the only way to survive this heinous world is to adapt to the spontaneous Calamity and the future danger for thee who's wise in the way of destruction. To survive this ride, this heaven, this hell, this neverending vagabond\u0026mdash; This Anamnesis.\u0026mdash;The one of a kind Second-Person Pov, ready to give you a seat to an action packed and emotional rollercoaster. A brand new experience, to a colorful memory. Become Long Leggy, and venture the broken world with no clear information given, with some slick reference and comedy thrown along the way.The cover belongs to its rightful owner, the sauce is in \"General Info.\"\u0026mdash;Unused to second person pov and still reluctant? Read \"Enter Me! The Skillionaire Says In Parentheses\" which took place in the same universe!",

      "description": "In the first life, he was a nameless shadow guard, killed by his own liege.In the second life, 'she' was proclaimed as a villainess and killed by the heroine, the very same girl whom she had spent her entire life loving.And now, the wrongly accused villainess has become one for real. Hand in hand with a 'villainess system', watch as Emilia destroys numerous plots and brings heroes to their knees.Collecting these so-called heroines, conquering their heart and soul so they would follow her of their own free will, and adding them to her ever-growing harem of beauties is just a matter of course.\u0026darr; Full Summary \u0026darr;Born and raised as a nameless shadow guard for his kingdom\u0026rsquo;s crown prince, his life\u0026rsquo;s purpose was to be used and discarded at the whims of his liege. And his meaningless life ended when the gaze of a princess lingered on him for too long. The crown prince had him beheaded without a second thought, as if throwing out trash.Transmigrating into the body of a baby girl, the nameless shadow finally had a name, a family, and a place to call her own. Throwing away his past, the shadow guard was now called \u0026lsquo;Emilia\u0026rsquo;, and walked on a new path to seek fulfillment. It was not meant to be, however, as the girl whom she had loved with all her heart and soul ended up mercilessly plunging a dagger through Emilia's love-struck heart at the highest point in her life.The crowd clamored at the \u0026lsquo;deserved death of the villainess\u0026rsquo;, and at that moment, the shadow could only wonder\u0026hellip; why? Why am I always the one to dedicate myself fully to someone, only to be thrown away like trash in the end?And thus, as her soul floated away cursing in resentment at the crowd, \u0026lsquo;Emilia\u0026rsquo; vowed to herself that in her next life she shall never be the one to fully dedicate herself. What she likes shall be held in her palm, and shall never escape.The moment the vow was made, a self-proclaimed villainess system proposed to partner with her, to explore and conquer the worlds through their anchors\u0026mdash;the heroes and heroines. And by cultivating this energy, she shall one day go back. Back to the world she was born as \u0026lsquo;Emilia\u0026rsquo; in, and face the so-called heroine once more. The second time they meet, Emilia won\u0026rsquo;t be the one drowning in regret!...Author's Note: The heroines are not just trophies she\u0026rsquo;s collecting, only to be forgotten once she collects them. Each of them will remain relevant throughout the story. And it won\u0026rsquo;t become a mess, promise!Release Rate = 7 chapters / week250+ Powerstones = 8 chapters / week500+ Powerstones = 9 chapters / weekAnd so on...

      "description": "Reed, a young man that had spent his entire life in the slums wished for a miracle. He dreamt that one day he'd escape the ghetto he had been born in and travel across the world. He longed to embark on an adventure and truly begin living a real life.Alas, it was not meant to be. The stars had other plans in mind for the young man.On the night of his sixteenth birthday, he had his life flipped upside down. Caught in the midst of a confrontation between two rival gangs, Reed suffered a fatal injury.As he laid on the street, Reed couldn't help but laugh at how unfair his life had been from beginning to end. Born poor? Sure. No parents? Okay. No opportunities in life? Fine. But his own miserable life, too? \"What more can I be deprived of?\" Reed muttered as he struggled to keep his eyes open. A soft voice chuckled and said, \"Much, much more, boy. But you'll soon have the opportunity to have all your wishes fulfilled.\"\"...If you can earn the right to obtain them.\"---------------------------------------------Let this message serve as a FINAL warning to those who have come in expecting the 'usual' type of story on this site.This is 'NOT' a wish-fulfillment based story. Please do NOT come into this novel with the expectation that you will get some kind of fearless action hero. The MC is everything but that.That he will be... this 'fearless, intrepid' person straight out of the FIRST chapter. A bold, charismatic hero with an unshakable resolve and iron will.   Get that irritating preconception out of your head right now if you dare venture further into the story. I KNOW that's what you're expecting because that's the common setup with the stories on this site. I am writing a story about personal growth, above all else. Be forewarned about that. I'm serious.That means that the character has to start from the bottom and work his way UP. Not in only in terms of power, but also in the strength of his character -- as in, maturing INTO someone who will become a hero. Not over the course of a SINGLE chapter like some stories do. Not in SINGLE arc, or volume, but over the course of the ENTIRE STORY.My main character starts off as COWARDLY, INDECISIVE, and WHINY. He is by NO measure a heroic person, or EVEN a whole person. He is weak-willed and flawed because that is how I HAVE WRITTEN him to be, for good reason. Now, it's your right to DISLIKE this decision I've made and not read the novel because of that. Absolutely. If you want an OP power-fantasy, then go find it elsewhere on the site. You do you. Don't let me or anyone stop you from reading what you want. But if you read my novel for what it is and then give it a poor review, criticizing it for having a \"flawed, detestable, and pathetic main character,\" I WILL delete your goddamned review on that point alone. tl;dr: My main character isn't fucking He-Man and the Terminator's baby. He's a human being with all the ugly, pathetic parts you don't like seeing in your OP Reincarnation novels.-------------------------------------------------Any comment or review you'd leave for the novel is worth more than gold to me. Have a good one.",

      "description": "Consume and evolve to become the strongest. The Collector, an alien warrior on a mission to absorb all life, transmigrates to a world of fantasy and magic. However, a battle with a god forces it to begin its journey as nothing more than a weak grub. Used to fighting against spaceships and machines, the Collector must now navigate its strange new world where instead of dealing with bullets and aircraft, it must now face magic and dragons. It must evolve from the weakest of the weak, the lowest of the low, and become strong, stronger than anything on the planet whether it be a knight, monster, or the very gods themselves. ===Reward System===1000 Powerstones = +1 Chapter1500 Powerstones = +2 Chapter2000 Powerstones = +3 Chapter50 Golden Tickets = +1 Chapter 150 Golden Tickets + +2 Chapter 250 Golden Tickets = +3 Chapter===Doever Writing Quality Guarantee===I can give a solid guarantee that the writing quality of this novel is of the highest tier on this website. There will be very few mistakes, and the few that do slip by me will not affect readability at all. Now, you may not agree with how the novel develops, but I can at the least guarantee that you will have no trouble actually reading what happens.Of course, I am not perfect, so please feel free to point out mistakes and problems and I will be more than happy to fix them!===Foreword===Evolution/Non-Human/Unique MC: If you like evolution based novels and nonhuman MCs, then you've come to the right place. The whole novel will be about consuming creatures and their bloodlines and evolving. The MC is also not the average isekai'd by truck average dude in most transmigration stories, it is an alien monster from the very beginning if that interests you any. Cold/Ruthless/Villain - Anti-Hero MC: If you like MCs that are on the colder and more ruthless side, the MC does not operate by conventional human morals and starts off as a villain and will be a questionable anti-hero at best.Slow Pace: Like my other novel on this site, this novel will have a slow pace compared to other works. Hopefully, this will enhance your experience as a reader with description rich, vivid and engaging fight scenes and environments. The slow pace will also contribute to fleshing out a significantly developed world as well as setting up for plot events that will have relevance throughout the entire novel.===Updates===Update Rate:  1 chapter per day + more for meeting goals===Discord Link===https://discord.gg/mKvkT36pSQFeel free to pop in anytime to ask questions!",

When there were no classes, the students were allowed to browse the library as they wished. Upon the commencement of the Mainland Divination Competition, Flanders sent all his students away so that they could gain life experience from all around the world. While he himself prepared to train behind closed-doors. However, he had never expected to find that his students were all of the extraordinary identities with outstanding talents. After leaving the Divination Academy, the students managed to throw the entire Continent of Divination into an uproar. Flanders had only come to find out later on, that not only were his students of noble statuses, they were also arrogant beyond words. \"",

      "description": "In 2030, the online game \u0026ldquo;Divine Realm\u0026rdquo; was released. When everyone entered the game, frantically working on leveling up, and fighting for items, Jack was in the novice city, leisurely lying down on his back and enjoying the scorching sun. Later, everyone discovered that Jack had not battled any bosses, nor had he ever been out of the novice city. However, his items and level were of the strongest existence in the entire \u0026ldquo;Divine Realm\u0026rdquo; game! At that moment, everyone was dumbfounded. The reason why Jack could relax so much while still being able to level up and gain resources was that he bounded with the Divine Talent System. As soon as the game started, the System gifted Jack 3000 Death Soldiers to work for him.What\u0026rsquo;s more, these Death Soldiers had unconditional loyalty to Jack. All the EXP and resources they gained would be offered to Jack. From then on, relying on these 3000 Death Soldiers, Jack gradually advanced in the \u0026ldquo;Divine Realm\u0026rdquo;.",

When humanity tried to rebuild, they discovered that most technology no longer worked. The laws that governed the world had changed!Steam technology rose in popularity after the apocalypse. Humanity entered a new golden age. Then, the seven nightmares attacked. Espers with strange powers appeared. Mutants took over most of the world.

My inventions will defeat the nightmares and save the world! Steam rifles, steam tanks, and steam mechs.

I guarantee the story continues to improve from there as you continue reading.  Political factions, wars, steam tech, mana mysteries, and more. Though the story starts in America, it also visits China, Europe, Africa, and other areas of the world later on.--------------------------------------------------Note from author: This novel was the winner of the Steampunk writing contest.

      "description": "The smell of blood invaded my nostrils. I watched helplessly as the woman standing over me raised her sword. I was completely drained, I had no mana left, no items, nothing. As the crimson tendrils held me down by my arms and legs, all I could do was wait for my death. As the sword drew near, I felt the last bit of courage I had disappear. I was going to die. Alone. In this god forsaken place filled with evil. And for what? To protect those \u0026lsquo;friends\u0026rsquo;? The same people who mocked me, took advantage of, and used me?Oh, who am I trying to fool? I was here only because of my own greed. Because I wanted to be useful to someone. Because I wanted to that group to need me. To value me. To have a reason to keep me around. How nai\u0026larr;\"\u0026rarr;ve I was, thinking that power would grant those wishes. All it did was help build a wall between me and everyone else. The sword approached. I saw the purple light reflect off the sword\u0026rsquo;s blade. After everything I went through, I hadn\u0026rsquo;t expected my death to be by the hands of another player. I saw her smile, but this time I didn\u0026rsquo;t think it was beautiful. It was an ugly smile because it was genuine. She was enjoying watching me die. She was enjoying killing me. The sword struck my chest and pierced my heart. I let out a scream of pain and agony. The pain was so real, all of this was so real. It shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be, but it was. What should have been a simple game had become my new reality \u0026ndash; all of our new reality. A reality filled with magic, war, blood, and death. My vision darkened as the pain slowly faded. I felt the last of my vitality leave my body. It felt cold. I wondered to myself, when would I stop being? When would my thoughts disappear?Soon, I saw those words I feared for all this time appear before me. \u0026ldquo;DEATH\u0026rdquo;, in the pale blue font the game always used. They remained suspended in the air for several seconds. It was over. After a long time of fighting, grinding, and exploring, it was finally over. I had died. This was the end of my story.Suddenly, words before me shifted and changed into something different. I took a shallow breath as I heard a faint heartbeat.* * *Cover art by me* * *We have a discord!

      "description": "The world as we know is over, Magic has been born through scientific research, things often thought of as legend or myth have become the reality for people living 2080. The cause of the sudden 'magic' outbreak? A terrorist attack that occurred on September 1st  2021. An unknown gas was released into the atmosphere and caused mutations to appear in children that were born from then on. Countries such as China now had a military force that contained highly trained magic users that could win wars on their own.  Warfare had changed and so did the governments of most countries, the power shifted from the core government itself and towards those with magic.This gave rise to a society which bent its knee to those with excessive magical power and those with potential were sent to prestigious academies in their respective countries.Our story picks up with an 18 year old aristocrat, Oliver Cromwell. He was outcast from his family due to a magic related incident that he has no memory of, he was given enough money to survive on and admitted to the Academy of Magical Excellence in Japan.3 chapters a week.Image rights belong to the original creator.",

It wasn\u0026rsquo;t as simple as climate change or tectonic movement. No, the fundamental laws of physics that governed everything were changing. Leonel was fairly lucky. His family was decently well off, his father loved him enough to brew vomit inducing nutrient rich smoothies every morning, and this was both the day of the National Championship and his 521st confession to his dream girl, Aina. As his father always said, nothing was more important than respect and persistence. Unfortunately, everything changed that night. At the after party of ages, the world reached a saturation point and an apocalypse descended. Abilities awakened. Sub-Dimensional Zones opened. Invalids rampaged through the Earth like a virus...Those who could evolve would have a slim chance for survival. Those who couldn\u0026rsquo;t would die.

He's just a commoner, working endlessly to maintaining the lifestyle of Mages.On his 15th birthday, his last chance to escape from a miserable life was destroyed when he was deemed to have no magic potential. For thousands of Serion's citizens that would be the end of their dreams. But how could this story be any fun, ending like that? Follow Karl and his friends while they tried to fight against the Kingdom's oppression. Will the system bend them to submission or will they break the chains of destiny? Spoiler alert: After thousands of years, an ancient Magic system will be reborn in the small Caiset village.What should you expect?- Kingdom Building: For sure! The heavy lifting will come later, I promise! Foundation is important, please be patient;- Epic battles: A Kingdom is not built without war and conflict. Who doesn't like good fights? Let's bring some excitement to this novel!;- Multiple leading characters: Karl convinced them to get on the bus, but this is a very long trip and everyone will need to drive a little;- Scientific Magic System: Especially Alchemy! I'm in no way trying to take the fantasy out of Magic. I just feel like trying to do something more logical;- World Building: I\u0026rsquo;m using some basic concepts from traditional Fantasy Worlds and trying to add some nice touches to make it unique;- Fun?: I'll try to insert some humor into the story, but that\u0026rsquo;s an experience we will go through together.Check out my spin-off novels, Merchant Queen and Harbinger of Death.

      "description": "On May 28 of the year 2010, the third awakening happened. Several smaller worlds had returned to connect with the main world as living beings of different races started to appear and some people managed to connect with the origin and gain control of various powers: control of fire, of water, of wind,  of air, and of the earth... In the midst of all these confusions, towers that gave unimaginable powers began to appear in all corners of the world, where those who already had powers could upgrade and become more powerful or even those who did not have powers could receive powers through tests of the tower. And because of these towers, conflicts started to happen in all corners of the world by those wanting to monopolize these towers.Luan Dimas was transported back four months before the third awakening that started the apocalypse on earth. Being a man who lived for a thousand years and had accumulated several techniques, he now had a new chance to correct some of his early mistakes. Luan decided to make the most of this new chance that the heavens had given to him.*The 'Earth' in this novel is not the same Earth we currently live on, so don't use our common sense for this novel. After all, this is pure fantasy.Discord Server: discord.gg/rK69edsWyt",

      "description": "(This book has been Cancelled)The Big Bang! It's the phenomenon known for being responsible for the Universe's birth. Except for those who were religious fanatics, most people had already come to at least partially accept this theory. As years passed, more proof that the Big Bang was the phenomenon that gave birth to the Universe continued to appear. At some point, religions ceased to exist as the claims of science simply couldn't be refuted anymore. Humanity had finally accepted as a whole that in this Universe, such a thing as gods didn't exist... or did they?However, humanity would soon find out that the Big Bang was just part one. That infinitesimally small point where the Big Bang originated... was still there! The Second Big Bang, which had a purpose unlike the first one, was about to begin.",

They would also seek superior weapons, including unbreakable war axes, or keen blades that could cut a giant tree with a single swing. Even so, Li Wensheng learned Immortal Arts from the very start! Though his scrawny form was exceedingly inconspicuous at first, he wielded Immortal Arts to smash long blades with his bare hands and crush giant hammers! Li Wensheng was flying everywhere on his sword while others were busy trying to surpass the limits of human speed. He could kill with a leaf or flower he plucked while others requested blacksmiths to hone their weapons. He cooked medicinal pellets with his cauldron, brewing Yuan Pellets that ascend cultivation while others trained their bodies to strengthen themselves. Martial arts champions: \u0026ldquo;Why aren\u0026rsquo;t you using any weapons?\u0026rdquo; Li Wensheng smiled, two of his fingers casting an immortal technique: Ten Thousand Swords Retrogression!At his words, every sword behind everyone\u0026rsquo;s back took to the skies without hope of control, gathering behind Li Wensheng into a rain of swords that covered the skies!

Those were his thoughts before shoving a person out of harm's way and getting struck by a truck.'If I could get a second chance, I want to live a fulfilling life and not waste it like this.'However, Albion's new life resolution was quickly challenged by a stroke of divine providence.\"What?

He is a driven and irritable young man, consumed by a desire to ensure his own future and free himself of the influence of his family, whom he resents for favoring his brothers over him. Consequently, he has no time for pointless distractions or paying attention to other people's problems. As it happens, time is something he is about to get plenty of. On the eve of the Cyoria's annual summer festival, he is killed and brought back to the beginning of the month, just before he was about to take a train to Cyoria. Suddenly trapped in a time loop with no clear end or exit, Zorian will have to look both within and without to unravel the mystery before him. And he does have to unravel it, for the time loop hadn't been made for his sake and dangers lurk everywhere... Repetition is the mother of learning, but Zorian will have to first make sure he survives to try again - in a world of magic, even a time traveler isn't safe from those who wish him ill.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/nobody103Website:https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/Fanart/Translation:https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2016/05/01/mol-links-fanart-translation-etc/FictionPress:https://www.fictionpress.com/u/804592/nobody103Cover Art Credit: https://www.royalroad.com/profile/78371(Note: I am not in anyway related to the creator nobody103, just a fan who wants to gain popularity for the novel)",

Thank you.Athan, a 16-year-old boy, lived until he was killed for a stupid reason. ( stupid reason \u0026 more in the prologue:v )But it seems that fate had stored different things for him as after death, His soul transmigrated to another world inside a dead body of a boy with the same name and same facial features as him.He also found out that a mysterious black whirlpool seemed to be inside him and connected to his soul.After the short unfortunate first life, he starts living his second life with more suffering that he chooses himself to get stronger but with that also comes happiness he had never experienced. A smooth sailing second life of Athan starts with something mystical inside his body and other benefits of it that could make him stronger with some suffering. However...he didn't know that due to his soul ( That was supposed to return to the source of the universe after death but instead, it transmigrated by someone for some purpose and that caused an adverse effect like increasing misfortune on his soul ) The benefits he receives ultimately becomes the source of his second doom that is even worse than death. But...that's when the future Void emperor is born. -------------------------------------------------------------------I wanted an MC that becomes stronger and reigns supreme without relying on anything external and he achieves his own unique power by virtue of his own hard work and ability. Although he gets benefits in the early stage of the story, That is the build-up for when he walks on the path he creates for himself. As you read more, it will get better so don't give up after just the first few chapters, At least please read the 2nd volume as The Real adventure starts in Volume 2[ Bloody Universe.] That's why my 103 chapters are free. [note: The First R-18 Chapter is 41. ]This is my first novel so expect some mistakes but I am striving to improve constantly because writing the story I play in my mind is so much fun and it's even more fun when people read it and enjoy it. ----I've started using Grammarly premium from chap 90 and onward but I've still yet to edit early chaps...Though I'm definitely planning to edit them later and when I get free time.I hope you like this book. Thank you for reading.PS:- I don't own the images on my LN's Cover. If the original owner sees this message, You can contact me.Discord: https://discord.gg/mCYTeRBuYx",

      "description": "Human beings will be invaded by another world a year later? Caruso accidentally binds himself to a system and logs into a [Magic World Online] game that can synchronize his power with reality a year in advance? Any magic, any skill, and any item can be brought to reality... The human metropolis was coming to an end. During that time, money, women, and houses that people yearned for in the past were reduced into mere waste. People only desire one thing: power! Immense power! One year later, the Earth was invaded by another world. Bizarre monsters were razing human territories and murdering humanity. Humanity also logged into [Magic World Online]. When they arrived, they saw a mage wielding a divine artifact and standing in the air. After he gently chanted a spell, he casually summoned a sky full of meteorites and killed a mountain-sized beast in a moment. Human players vowed to become a mage as powerful as this NPC. The next second, the game system's voice stunned all human players. \"Ding-dong. Congratulations, Caruso, you successfully killed a level 12 Demon Dragon Lord!\"",

However, his interview happens to be on a Friday and on his way there he suffers an accident that changes his life.He finds the answers that everyone has been looking for, but, in exchange, he is thrown into a world where his life is always in peril. Living side by side with death.He has to fight and kill, to save himself and, possibly, the rest of humanity.Follow Junhyuk as he treads on the path of becoming a Legend amongst Legends.**A licensed novel from Munpia**---Editor Views - By Ekdud:Legend of Legend is a novel based on the battle arena games such as LoL, dota and others like it. Countless number of lifeforms of different races from multiple dimensions and worlds are brought into the \u0026lsquo;Valley of Death\u0026rsquo; where they start off as minions and where a small percentage of them unlock abilities.Those who are able to unlock all 3 abilities, as well as the final ultimate ability, are able to become \u0026lsquo;Heroes\u0026rsquo;, the game characters we would be playing.It is an extremely interesting novel because instead of viewing from the angle of the main focus of the game, the novel takes a different approach as the viewpoint is shifted towards the lackeys on the side. There are other \u0026lsquo;Heroes\u0026rsquo; by the main character throughout the story as well where the allied Heroes are helping him and the enemy Heroes trying to kill him.Also, the entire story is not entirely situated in the \u0026lsquo;Valley of Death\u0026rsquo;, the main character also has issues in his real life. The main character will have to deal and adapt as he switches back and forth between the \u0026lsquo;Valley of Death\u0026rsquo; and the real-life world.",

      "description": "Do read my WSA 2021 novel **Alone: Tale of a Monster Hunter**. It would mean a lot to me if you could read it and give your valuable review. Thanks in advance. ****The novel follows the story of Arnold, a porter, who accompanies warriors and superhumans inside dangerous dungeons, which are distinguished by their colours. The porters were always mistreated by the modern human civilization and even though their job was riskier than that of warriors and superhumans, their existence was never appreciated nor were they paid well.No one knows why these dungeons started to appear all over the world. The only thing they know was the dangers that would find their way into the world if they didn't kill the monsters. But only a selected few cared about the calamity because for the rest it was all about earning money and gaining power. But nothing in this new world is constant and everything keeps changing, and this time the change would find its way towards an ordinary Porter.After stealing a scroll from the dungeon, he ran off to his home. The scroll gave him powers no one could've imagined to gain. But he wasn't alone. 9 other humans had been granted similar powers... powers of the Gods! What would Arnold do with his newfound powers? Will he kill the other 8 Paladins and rule over the world which had oppressed him for years? Or will he rise against the Gods and make them repent for their crimes? Can the strength lent by the Gods be sufficient to deal with them once and for all? Would he be able to defeat his creator? Or will he join the Gods instead? Too many questions, too little time. The decisions he would make could be the end of humanity Or would an ordinary Porter, become he world's only hope? Follow me on the journey to the power of this ordinary Porter as he becomes the Savior or the Devil. *******************Gold tier award-winning novel of WPC#130.*******************Warning:There might be a few grammatical errors in the early chapters, so if you are a grammar nazI then please proceed with caution. Also, the MC isn't very bright and will do a lot of stupid things from time to time. So if you like a cool and calculating MC you won't be seeing him like that until later chapters (Chapter 100 or so). I'm telling this to y'all here so you don't start yelling at me in the comments or review. All in all, I've tried to make the MC as realistic as I could. Any advice is appreciated.

At the center, a boy; brought up by an exiled mage, steps into a life of independence. A test to try and change his life for the better after witnessing what war can do to a person. The walk towards finding a stable living gets toppled as a unique magical element awakens. Using people, toying with emotions, doing anything and everything to get what he wants, this is the life of the next Death Reaper. Mostly emotionless, life continues as questions about his state of mind and being remains clouded behind many personas.This isn\u0026rsquo;t the story of a single man, it\u0026rsquo;s the story of a whole world. Read as the world builds itself from the ground up. Conspiracies, evil, the dark side of humanity. In addition, tis the start of a new age; the birth of monsters \u0026ndash; a story depicting the tales of the first heroes and demons to ever exist. The Wielder of Death Magic isn\u0026rsquo;t a typical fantasy. The heroes don\u0026rsquo;t summon forth power from heroes of old, here, the characters are the ones who make up the myths and legends for the next generation. Amidst the turmoil, Staxius, he lives on, watching and waiting as the world grows. P.S, I\u0026rsquo;m not that normal of a writer, my advice is to not expect anything going into this world. Forget everything, I personally, don\u0026rsquo;t care about rules and limitations and what can be considered to be the norm \u0026ndash; the characters are given life, the world moves on its own; I\u0026rsquo;m just a spectator. No plot, nothing planned, all that you read is the product of the characters moving and acting individually. As opposed to me subjecting them with my emotions, the connection is reversed. They are the ones who dictate the story (Believe it or not, that's the way I write) A world, a story, characters, and the foolish author; we all evolve as one. On behalf of the people mentioned above, thanks for reading, I appreciate it all.[Cover is copyrighted by Sxperimental]",

Our MC (Min Hong) who was born with an extremely feeble body with no hope of cultivation, began his adventurous journey in a world where respect could only be earned by possessing absolute strength...A world where rules don't apply to the strong, and the weak are trampled upon by the strong. A world where experts battle Qilins, Dragons and Phoenixes with impunity...Min Hong with nothing other than a desperate grandfather, a heartbroken mother and a sick family, was driven by a deep desire to obtain enough strength to protect his family...But, as life has a separate plan for man, asides from the menial ones he makes, what was meant to be Min Hong's day of weeping became his first step to obtaining unrivaled power... The kind of power that instills deference into all life.... Dragons bow, Phoenixes cry in fear, praise and servitude...Armed with nothing but willpower and desperation, even Lady Luck had to feel for this youth. She blessed him extraordinarily, pushing him to the point where he stumbled upon an extremely Ancient Primordial Treasure; 'The Eye of the Myriad Universe'.------------------------------------------------------------------How do I comprehend the Dao of Oblivion? Min Hong asked.To comprehend the Dao of Oblivion, you have to know how it came to be... The Ancient Heavenly Monkey replied.What does Oblivion mean to you? The monkey asked.Oblivion is emptiness... a state of nothingness... it is an endless entity that was never there but always present... it existed before any other entity came to be... even the Chaos itself was birthed by Oblivion... it is the progenitor of all Universal Daos and lords over all things...Oblivion created the Chaos out of boredom... created the Dao of Will to control the Chaos when the Chaos began to rebel...------------------------------------------------------------------I am open to critics...

The answer you gave is invalid in this era. That cultivation system you are talking about is a two-millennium old history. I don't know how you came to know about those, but it's better to erase them from your memory.\u0026rdquo;________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________This is what Aryan got to hear from his gramps, on his fifth birthday.Wang Huang, a genius venerable cultivator from the ancient era, died in an unforeseen accident while searching for his path to immortality.After being stuck in a dark space for an unknown period, he took rebirth as the first son of Aditya and Anisa. Till the age of five, he was fantasizing of becoming an overpowered MC with a harem filled with seductive, voluptuous and alluring ladies.But little did he know at that time, that the world of cultivation has taken many twists and turns over the past two millennia, and his past knowledge of cultivation is outdated!!!Even though Aryan past life knowledge became trash in that new era, he didn\u0026rsquo;t give up on his dream of becoming an overpowered MC and continued his journey. But again, little did he know, that the upcoming future events, starting from Cultivation, followed by Cross-dressing, Sci-Fi, Cultivation Technique\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;Will keep on crushing him and his world view!!",

I will lead guild Sol Invictus. Denizens of the 7 hells, respect me. Servants of the 11 heavens, know fear. Guild Invictus, know the suffering of training so you can wrest victory from the jaws of those who dare doubt you. This is a story about a snake named Tycondrius waking up in a fantasy world of swords and sorcery. There is action, violence, unapologetic murder, and arrogant displays of power. There is an emphasis on combat growth as well as psychological growth on more than a few members of Guild Invictus. There is camaraderie and also the inevitable comedic dialogue amongst manly men. There are even elements of romance and Tycon running away from terrifying, powerful women. (Did you know most female snakes eat their partners after mating?) Give this book a read.

      "description": "Synopsis: Certain things are not meant to be touched, especially ancient weapons of unknown origin.Meet our protaganist, Juin, a less than average human from Earth; a thin, well-known weakling who was afraid of his own shadow and was basically everyone\u0026rsquo;s favorite punching bag.An incident in the past made him even more of a wimp than before. One day, while being bullied, he accidentally summoned a demon from another world. And what made it worse was that\u0026hellip; He had summoned a Daemon King from another dimension; one who had the emotional maturity of a teenager and the mouth of a sailor.With Juin's fear of basically everything and the arrogant Daemon King who was afraid of nothing, what would the 16-year-old's life be from now onward?With the help, guidance, and insult from the Daemon King, as well as other supernatural beings that kept popping out of nowhere, Juin soon learned that he had to either grow faster or die a horrible death. Along his journey, he met with all sorts of temptations and exciting adventures, as well as finding out that there was more to what he thought he knew about himself. At the end of the day, could the Daemon King find a way to separate himself from his vessel, or are their destinies more interlinked than they thought?xxxNote from author: Except for first chapter, which is a prologue and set in another dimension, the rest of volume one would focus mostly on Earth. The first volume would focus Lucifer and Juin's developments, especially the latter's development both in skills and character.  It might seem a little slow pace at first, but that's because I'm trying to build a piece everything up one by one, giving you a better immersion as you journey through the Demon King's Cowardly vessel.Honestly, I would love to hear your opinions on the development of the characters and the world.

Humanity only panicked in the last seconds before it hit the surface, the explosion engulfed everyone leaving them a short delay to say their prayers and have a peaceful passing.But, one orange tabby cat could be called lucky or unlucky at the same time, the friction of the meteorite colliding with the earth created a very small portal between dimensions, the delay of the explosion gave the owner of the cat enough time for her to throw the cat into the portal!It was unknown if it was the right thing to do.The explanation for the \"chaotic neutral\" Tag, by that I mean that the MC won't get out of his way to save others and might even abandon those close to him in certain situations, he is both selfish and very emotional due to the things he went through and he also fears death quite a bit, but he would also act kind on situations and seem like a good guy which he isn't.

After years of intense conflicts between his guild, Hellscape, and the guild of his former infidel lover, Darkrow, things came to a head when Draco conquered all. Now, nothing stood in his way of total conquest within the highly acclaimed second world of mankind, as he intended to fortify his new empire. Unfortunately, a timely assassination sent him back into the wheel of time for reincarnation, but not even the Gods gave him peace of death.

      "description": "When Alex was twelve, he was told that his destiny was to protect the sea of worlds that made up the realmverse and the large numbers of races living in them, as they felt he was chosen by the realmverse because he had a peerless and unique Body Constitution. Born with vast and astonishing godly abilities, he is now in a race against time to reach the apex stage of cultivation called: 'Guardian of Sea of Life' or 'Master of Realms', a stage where he would possess the absolute power to defend the realmverse from an enormous, overwhelming armies of tremendously proliferative Alien beings; strange humanoid lifeforms that also practice cultivation and whose sole intent is to maraud realmverses and enslave all inhabitants in them. But this cultivation stage is impossible to attain as he must comprehend and cultivate the ultimate energy called 'Genesis Realmforce Energy', an energy that would result from the fusion of hundreds of Originforce energies. Although the 'Master of Realms' cultivation stage is an impossible stage to reach, Alex would try to attain it by seeking for the lost 'LIBRARY SYSTEM' which would infuse his memory with the complete comprehension of the mysteries of Originforce energies, and the hidden 'GENE SYSTEM' that would inject his powerful divinely blood with the primordial genes of extinct, monolithic ancient races whenever he accomplishes insanely difficult tasks set by the godly, primeval creators of the systems. Also, he would seek for the 'ANCESTRAL BEAST SYSTEM' that would produce mutated or evolved copies of extinct primordial beasts that once existed countless eons of years ago. Then he would try to augment his damaging power to unparalleled degrees by seeking for Marvel-Weapons; Treasure-weapons of tremendous, apocalyptic-level devastating power which belonged to dead, ancient divine experts that birthed the four forms of cultivation. But would he be able to discover the Library System and the Gene System to gain new powerful abilities? The Ancestral Beast System to summon cloned versions of inexistent, planet-sized, havoc-wreaking abyssal creatures to aid him in the far-future deadly battles? And ultimately, Marvel-Weapons to vastly increase his overall destructive power? Would he able to achieve all these before the next, full invasion of his Realmverse? Or would he grow to become very powerful that he would then invade other Realmverses and become their hegemon? ***So, journey with our stunning hero, Alex as he begins to conquer known and unknown realms and dimensions, and unifies kingdoms and territories with the help of the 'Worlds Domination Ultimate Support System' which he would awaken later.***Tags:--> # SYSTEM [Multiple Systems]--> # ACTION [Epic Battles]--> # ADVENTURE --> # CULTIVATION [Energy, Soul, Body \u0026 Bloodline (physique) Cultivation] --> # ROMANCE--> # HAREM--> # WEAK-TO-STRONG MC--> # KIND-AND-GENEROUS MC--> # NAIVE-TO-SMART MC--> # RUTHLESS MC--> # OVERPOWERED-MC--> # OVERPOWERED-ENEMIES --> # BEAST COMPANIONS \u0026 MONSTER PETS--> # MATURE (Above 18)--> # MYRIAD NON-HUMAN RACES~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*PS: This novel is set in a fantasy/quasi-technological universe.

      "description": "DON'T READ THIS NOVEL PLEASEThe most powerful being in the world, the World Monarch, overseeing everything in the world like it was in the palm of his hands. But like all great power, a heavy burden came with it.The 10th to succeed grew tired of it all and wanted to lessen the weight he was bearing on his shoulders, to have a more comfortable life, and to have a family. He decided to split the World into Ten Domains and made his loyal Knights become the Domain Monarchs. Each of them became the Monarchs of Nine of the Ten Domains, with him overseeing only the Tenth. He named the domains from the names of the World Monarchs, including himself.After 36 years of peace and prosperity, a Great Catastrophe occurred, causing each Domain's countries to merge into one complete landmass. People who had inhuman abilities started to show up, and creatures of terror pouring out from who knows where\u0026mdash;plunging the whole world into utter mayhem. These vile foreign creatures took over the Three of the Ten Domains, while the remaining are barely holding their borders from the monsters. Everyone looked to the man who was once called the \"10th World Monarch\", the symbol of authority and power, for guidance through their intense hardships. However, he was nowhere to be found. All hope was lost.The protagonist of the story, born after the formation of the Domains, rescued an old man from a dangerous situation that led him in harm's way. Being in a vegetative state, he was unaware of everything in the outside world, including The Great Catastrophe. Waking up with the world already in ruins, and people adapted to the changes. The game-like mechanics that only Liu Kai can see will help him throughout his adventures to discover the mysteries of how the world evolved.===========================================Join our Discord Server using this link (https://discord.gg/vZtfKFx), and you can suggest to the novel to a certain extent that we would allow you.

Armed with an unrivaled healing factor and an inhumane pain threshold, Kuro opts to go for a reckless direct approach in this world instead of a stealthy and cautious one, and as a result, slowly gains attention bit by bit.Having previously been a loner in his old life, he interacts and befriends people for the first time in his existence, however, his blunt nature also sees him making just as many enemies, both big and small. By combining his old assassin skills with the magic powers of this world, along with his high resistance to pain and rapid regeneration, he doesn't take long to establish himself as a formidable force in this world. Initially, Kuro only faces minor threats, like weaker monsters and bandits. But before too long, the threats slowly but surely become more and more severe...from Zombies to a bloodthirsty empire to Vampires and Demons, and even divine beings...however, as the enemies he faces grow stronger, so does Kuro, gaining rare powers that have never or rarely ever been seen in this world...Genre - FantasySub-Genres - Isekai, Action, Magic, Dark Fantasy, Romance, ComedyAge-Rating - Pg-13 Warning: Mild Profanity, Mild Sexual Content, ViolenceFor updates and discussions, join my Discord server: https://discord.gg/sRbx9VbTVPFor character designs and other posts, visit my Instagram page: @aimdaqs",

It was the time of night.Damien who hadn't broken his eye contact with the girl in front of him, pushed his hand against the wall which now rested beside his beautiful girl's head. Turning his body, he first looked at his butler who had his head bowed. With great courage, the butler came to meet his Master's eyes, \"Do you have any other better time? Or should it be after I wring your neck?\" Damien asked calmly tilting his head. Not a second later, the butler ran out of the room to return back with Mr. Reverale after twenty minutes.\"Damien, are we having a late tea party?\" Mr. Reverale came to greet but the master of the house had other plans. Spotting the knife that was stuck to the apple on the table, he reached for it to pull it out.Just as Mr. Reverale went to exchange a handshake with him, Damien took hold of his hand to place it on the table. In one swift movement as if he were chopping onions, he chopped the four fingers of the man off his hand making him yelp and cry in pain.\"No one touches what is mine.

      "description": "-COMPLETED-WARNING: FL is scheming and evil.Like almost every dramatic romance novel, Lily Qin\u0026rsquo;s story began with an evil stepmother, a scheming stepsister, and a dumb ex-fiance. At twenty, she fell prey to their grand scheme and became the laughingstock of the country. In despair, she left.Seven years later, Lily Qin rose from the ashes.She was labeled as an empress, an iron lady, a genius, and a prodigy. She was Miss Tycoon.Now, at twenty-seven, Lily Qin was an established businesswoman who was single-handedly controlling her multinational company abroad. She was beautiful, smart, and successful. Women envied her while men couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but worship her ethereal beauty.With her devastating past, everyone had assumed that Lily would exact revenge on the people who had wronged her. Who would have guessed that behind that beaming smile of hers was a numb heart that aimed only to make more profit?\"You got it wrong.\" Lily elegantly propped her chin on the back of her hand. \"I am seeing you today because we have something in common. We're both villains in somebody else's eyes. And I think it's time for us villains to get our own happy ending. Don't you think so?\"---Zhuo Jingren\u0026rsquo;s love for Lily Qin was something that only he knew. Ever since they were children, he had his eyes on her. Yet, every time he had tried to confess, he would end up fainting from nervousness.So when Lily Qin promised to marry him if he became richer than her, Zhou Jingren did not hesitate to leave the orphanage and work his way up just to become her man.Who would have thought that years later, when he was successful and feared by many, he would come back to an engaged Lily Qin?Then she mistook him for an escort after eating his tofu? Preposterous!The worst thing was, she seemed to have forgotten everything about him. Hadn\u0026rsquo;t she promised to marry him the moment he became more prominent than her family? Now, after taking advantage of him, she dared to run away?This woman was a liar!He gritted his teeth as he watched her approach him. He was about to say something mean when she suddenly spoke. \u0026ldquo;Are you my new bodyguard?\u0026rdquo; She did not even wait for him to answer before tossing her car keys at him. \u0026ldquo;Drive. Let\u0026rsquo;s go wreak some havoc.\u0026rdquo;Thus, the mafia\u0026rsquo;s big boss became Lily Qin\u0026rsquo;s bodyguard.---\"So? What do you want as a compensation?\" Zhuo Jingren asked her once again before laying down next to her. His elbow was resting on the ground and his palm was supporting his head as he looked at her intently.\u0026nbsp;The first thing that Lily noticed about Zhuo Jingren when he laid next to her was his exposed tanned chest. This made him look more casual\u0026hellip; and hot. She didn't even realize she was staring at the latter.\"Why are you staring at me like that?\" He smirked at her. \"Do you want me to compensate you with my body?\"Lily immediately rolled her eyes at the latter. \"Who wants your body? Hmp! I want money!\"\"Your mind is always thinking of money but your body actually betrays you. Am I right to say that I have a shameless wife?\"\"Hah! I am a strong and independent woman of the 21st century. I know what I want. But if you insist on giving your body, I will take it too!\" Lily shamelessly said, taking off her stilettos. However, just when Lily was about to lie down beside Zhuo Jingren, he suddenly pulled her on top of him. With her body on top of his, their faces were really close and they could even feel each other's breath.\u0026nbsp;\"What a shameless woman,\" he noted, the smile on his face only deepened.....

If you wish to undertake the book and appreciate the story, please read it up till chapter 300s to understand the sudden twist in chapter 100s.i will admit that during that time, I am still a young budding author and could have expressed the story better in the early hundred chapters.

      "description": "This is both a work of science fiction and an exploration of the meaning of life, love, literature and art. Brainpower is no longer the main ingredient for being human in this far distant future world.  Spirituality, physical balance, and diligence all come together as integrity for Chen Mu, the Card Apprentice.  The cards which Chen Mu masters in his own scrappy way, distill all the powers of the cosmos \u0026ndash;  human and nonhuman \u0026ndash;  into something that is not a book, not technology, and neither art nor magic, but is these and more.  Learn about these strange cards, which can embody everything you might imagine for the future of technology, but also a future beyond technology which promotes the best, and sometimes the worst, from mankind\u0026rsquo;s past.",

      "description": "To rise from defeat; to revive amidst the dissipation. As the vast oceans turn to dust and the thunder and lightning fade away,That strand of spiritual mist once again approaches our great world. With the shackles that bound our world now severed\u0026mdash;A whole new world of mystery and wonder awaits, As we turn the corner...------The Sacred RuinsIs a story set in a post-apocalyptic world. A world that has recovered to a state that is roughly equal to our own world in terms of technology and culture, although its ancient history remains largely unknown. The story begins during the post-graduation trip of our protagonist, where he discovers some ancient ruins and witnesses \u0026ldquo;the great change\u0026rdquo;, an upheaval that changed everything. The changing earth not only brought about new, unexplored landscape but also sparked the evolution of all organisms. Plants and animals started gaining sentience and some humans obtained unimaginable powers. The legends, myths, and tales of old seemed to have suddenly come to life as the earth entered a new era where beasts and men formed factions, explored new lands and ultimately struggled for supremacy.We follow the MC as he grows from being an eccentric young man into a badass expert warrior while meeting other funny characters and forming brotherly bonds. We watch as he falls into just as much hilarious situations as he does perilous ones, all the while wondering and slowly discovering the mysteries of this world. Just why was the world destroyed in the first place? Who or what had triggered this earth-shattering \u0026ldquo;change\u0026rdquo;? What profundities lie behind the process of evolution? ------Chen Dong is one of the top authors in the Chinese Qidian site and this particular novel has been number one on its monthly charts for several months straight. If you are looking for a funny and unique novel that is free from the cliches of reincarnation and cultivation, this might just be what you are looking for. The story develops quite slowly for the first ten chapters or so but becomes much better paced afterwards.------Release Rate: 7 Chapters/Week",

Explosions! Science!To be perfectly honest, this novel is about your typically overpowered protagonist who does get looked down from time to time but always overcomes the odds with his own special power. He's abit more mature having grown up on his own and just a littttttttle bit dense.Although it always ends up with him winning, it always happens in an interesting (subjective) and fun way that makes me enjoy reading this.The novel has elements of lighthearted comedy from time to time and I do chuckle at how direct the humor is.It's not as smart as say WMW nor does it weave an intricate story much like Ergen's novels. More importantly, its fun and it doesn't try to hide it.",

      "description": "After dying from a strange terminal illness, Ling Lan was reborn into a world 10000 years into the future. Although she dearly wished she could just live a peaceful and uneventful life in her new healthy body, fate had other plans ... Forced to disguise herself as a boy just so she could inherit her deceased father's premium military benefits, Ling Lan's journey to adulthood was full of challenges. After much difficulty, she finally turned sixteen when she could drop the charade. But before she could grasp her newfound freedom to get married and start her own family, a twist of fate results in her being thrown into the Federation's top military boys' school. With these twists of fate, Ling Lan had little choice but to walk further and further down a path of no return, one of cold and aloof dominance ... ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* ryuxenji the translator here. :3 Here are some other things you should know: 1) This story is NOT primarily a romance. QI's system right now categorizes all novels taken from the female novel Chinese site (\u0026#36215;\u0026#28857;\u0026#22899;\u0026#29983;\u0026#32593;) as 'romance' without fail, regardless of whether they truly are romance. So, if you are here just for the romance, you might want to find a different novel. There will be some romance eventually, but most of this novel is Sci-Fi/Xianxia with a lot of world-building and character development. 2) I use British spelling. So, please ensure spelling errors are really errors before reporting them. 3) No matter what the release rate up top says, the guaranteed release rate right now is 1 chp/day (a.k.a. 7 chps/week). All else is extra at my discretion. (I'll try my best, but RL responsibilities come first.)",
